Introduce yourself. Explain your roles and responsibility

Difference between deployment and statefulset
Ans: Deployments are used for stateless applications, StatefulSets for stateful applications
     The pods in a deployment are interchangeable, whereas the pods in a StatefulSet are not.
     Deployments require a service to enable interaction with pods, while a headless service handles the podsâ€™ network ID in StatefulSets.
     
Difference between service and headless service
Ans: A Kubernetes service is a logical abstraction for a deployed group of pods in a cluster
    A headless service is a service with a service IP but instead of load-balancing it will return the IPs of our associated Pods. 
    
How do you make sure you're application is running always in k8s cluster? 
Ans: kubectl describe pod pod_name --namespace kube-system 
     The Status field should be "Running" - any other status will indicate issues with the environment.
     
What do you know about pod disruption budget? 
Ans: A Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) allows you to limit the disruption to your application when its pods need to be rescheduled for some reason such as upgrades or            routine maintenance work on the Kubernetes nodes. 

How you give access to k8s cluster? 
Ans: go get k8s.io/client-go@kubernetes-<kubernetes-version-number>

How does my ec2 instance access to k8s cluster? 
Ans: via SSH
     via AWS Session Manager
     
How does my application running in ec2 instance access to s3 service? 

How to block incoming traffic for single ec2 instance? suppose I've 10 instances, I need to block for single instance
Ans: use a network Access Control List (ACL) or security group rules in your VPC.
